# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In the dashboard the information populated based on a user-selected test subject ID. A bar chart, bubble chart and a gauge chart also update once the ID has been changed. Code has been written using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

All CSS, JS and images required are under the static folder. The main HTML file index.html is in the root directory of the Github repo.

The dashboard can be viewed here: https://stu-vic.github.io/Plot.ly-Homework---Belly-Button-Biodiversity/
